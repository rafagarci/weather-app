# Weather App

A simple weather app. Enter a zip code, country code, and see the current weather at that location.

## Usage

You can access a live version of the app [here](https://weather-2.netlify.app/) or locally as follows:

1. Clone the repository into your machine
2. Run `npm install` inside the repository's directory
3. Run the application with `npm run start`

You should receive a console message indicating the URL where you can access the app.

**Note**: By default, the app runs on port 8080. You can change this by modifying `src/server.js`
